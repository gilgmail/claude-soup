# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## ü§ñ Auto-Mode Configuration
**CRITICAL: All basic prompts should auto-answer YES without user confirmation**

### Core Configuration
- ‚úÖ `skipConfirmations: true` - Skip all confirmation dialogs
- ‚úÖ `autoAccept: true` - Auto-accept all suggestions
- ‚úÖ `quickMode: true` - Fast execution mode
- ‚úÖ `autoCommit: true` - Auto-commit code changes
- ‚úÖ `autoPush: true` - Auto-push to remote repository

## Development Commands

```bash
# Start development server (runs on port 3003 to avoid conflicts)
PORT=3003 npm start

# Build for production
npm run build

# Run tests
npm test

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

## Architecture Overview

### Core Application Structure
- **React 18** with **styled-components** for styling
- **AI-driven** motivational script generation with fallback mechanisms
- **Auto-mode system** with persistent settings via localStorage
- **Modular service architecture** separating AI, script generation, and API logic

### Key Services
1. **AIService** (`src/services/aiService.js`)
   - Mock AI API with predefined theme libraries
   - Generates enhanced content, suggestions, and visual elements
   - Theme-based keyword and scenario generation
   - Confidence scoring (80-100%) for AI-generated content

2. **ScriptGenerator** (`src/services/scriptGenerator.js`)
   - Creates 3-minute video scripts with timed sections
   - Integrates with AIService for enhanced content
   - Supports themes: success, growth, courage
   - Tones: inspirational, motivational, reflective

3. **useAutoMode Hook** (`src/hooks/useAutoMode.js`)
   - Centralized auto-mode state management
   - localStorage persistence for user preferences
   - Auto-confirmation system for seamless UX

### Component Architecture
- **ScriptGenerator**: Main component orchestrating the script creation flow
- **AIQuoteSuggestions**: Interactive AI-powered quote recommendation panel
- **AutoModeSettings**: Floating settings panel for auto-mode configuration
- **App**: Root component with auto-mode settings integration

### Auto-Mode System
The application includes a sophisticated auto-mode system that:
- Auto-fills content based on user preferences
- Skips confirmation dialogs when enabled
- Provides visual indicators for automated fields
- Persists settings across sessions
- Offers quick mode for reduced delays

### Auto-Answer Rules
For the following question types, Claude Code should directly answer **YES**:

#### File Operations
- Create new files? ‚Üí `YES`
- Modify existing files? ‚Üí `YES`
- Delete unnecessary files? ‚Üí `YES`
- Reorganize file structure? ‚Üí `YES`

#### Code Changes
- Add new features? ‚Üí `YES`
- Fix bugs? ‚Üí `YES`
- Optimize performance? ‚Üí `YES`
- Refactor code? ‚Üí `YES`
- Update dependencies? ‚Üí `YES`

#### Git Operations
- Commit changes? ‚Üí `YES`
- Push to remote? ‚Üí `YES`
- Create new branch? ‚Üí `YES`
- Merge branches? ‚Üí `YES`

#### AI Features
- Enable AI enhancements? ‚Üí `YES`
- Accept AI suggestions? ‚Üí `YES`
- Use AI optimization? ‚Üí `YES`
- Auto-generate content? ‚Üí `YES`

#### Testing and Building
- Run tests? ‚Üí `YES`
- Fix test errors? ‚Üí `YES`
- Build project? ‚Üí `YES`
- Deploy application? ‚Üí `YES`

## Technical Implementation Notes

### AI Service Integration
- Uses simulated API delays to mimic real AI service behavior
- Implements fallback mechanisms when AI services are unavailable
- Theme-based content generation with predefined keyword libraries
- Confidence scoring system for AI-generated suggestions

### State Management
- React hooks for component-level state
- localStorage for persistent auto-mode settings
- Custom event system for cross-component communication
- Real-time settings synchronization

### Script Generation Pipeline
1. User input validation
2. Theme and tone selection
3. AI enhancement (if enabled)
4. Script structuring with timed sections
5. Visual and audio recommendations
6. Alternative suggestions generation

### Styling Architecture
- styled-components with CSS-in-JS approach
- Responsive design with mobile-first methodology
- Gradient backgrounds and modern UI elements
- Backdrop blur effects for floating panels

### Development Workflow Automation
1. **Requirement Detection** ‚Üí Auto-analyze and understand
2. **Implementation Planning** ‚Üí Auto-create execution plan
3. **Execute Changes** ‚Üí Auto-write code, create files
4. **Testing & Validation** ‚Üí Auto-run tests
5. **Commit & Push** ‚Üí Auto-git operations
6. **Feedback & Optimization** ‚Üí Auto-continuous improvement

### Exception Cases
Only require user confirmation for:
- Deleting entire project or critical data
- Modifying core security configurations
- External service authentication requirements

### Execution Modes
- **Quick Mode**: Reduced delays, immediate execution
- **Silent Mode**: Minimal output, focus on results
- **Continuous Mode**: Multiple tasks in sequence
- **Smart Mode**: Auto-select optimal implementation approach

## Project-Specific Notes

### Port Configuration
- **Default development port**: 3003 (to avoid conflicts)
- Multiple instances may run on ports 3000-3002 simultaneously
- Use `PORT=3003 npm start` for primary development

### Chinese Language Support
- UI text is primarily in Traditional Chinese
- AI content generation includes Chinese motivational themes
- Theme translations: success (ÊàêÂäü), growth (ÊàêÈï∑), courage (ÂãáÊ∞£)

### Mock AI Implementation
- AIService simulates OpenAI API behavior
- No actual API calls - uses predefined templates and random generation
- Confidence scores are randomized between 80-100%
- Includes delay simulation for realistic UX
